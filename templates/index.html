      This is a in progrss website that I have setup and is in active delopment. Feel free to look around though and if you want to simulate some dice just add a / then the number of sides you want. For example if you want a D20 add "/20" to the end of the base url. Also if you are interensted in my TODO list go to "/todo" to see more. Most of the stuff on the website is for place holders and will most likly change. If you would like to see more you can click <a href="https://github.com/crabbymonkey/dice-roller">here</a> to view the source code.
